**Final Project Example**

I made a sample data visualization report using R Shiny. You can access this project [Gapminder Visualization](https://rodericktung.shinyapps.io/gapminder_shiny_project/). Please notice that the dataset and this site exists for the
purposes of education and making Shiny App examples. I do not update the dataset. If
you want to do actual research, please refer to the (Gapminder website)[https://www.gapminder.org/] and review the way it takes to estimate those statistics. All errors are my own.
