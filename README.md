I made a sample data visualization report using R Shiny. You can access this project [Gapminder Visualization](https://rodericktung.shinyapps.io/gapminder_shiny/). Please notice that the dataset and this site exists for the
purposes of education and making Shiny App examples. I do not update the dataset. If
you want to do actual research, please refer to the [Gapminder website](https://www.gapminder.org/) and review the way it takes to estimate those statistics. All errors are my own.

Generally speaking, you should try to integrate as many as functionalities into your
Shiny app. For example, below is a bubble chart that you may have been seen before in Prof. Hans Rosling's [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen). However, it is a static plot. Try to think about making it interactive!
